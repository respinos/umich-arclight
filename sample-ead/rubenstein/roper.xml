      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Daniel C. Roper Papers, 1860-1958 (bulk 1933-1938), consist chiefly of professional and
        political correspondence, including telegrams and memoranda, but also include speeches,
        financial papers, clippings, invitations, legal papers, printed material, and pictures. The
        collection primarily documents Roper's term as Secretary of Commerce during the first
        administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In general the papers provide an inside
        look at this Democratic administration during the early depression years, as well as the
        relationships among business, government, and politics. In particular, Roper had close ties
        to people in the business community and was sympathetic to their concerns. In addition, the
        collection tracks the course of the New Deal in the Department of Commerce and the career of
        Roper not only as a United States government official in Roosevelt's cabinet but also as a
        progressive Democrat. However, there are some gaps in these professional files in that there
        is very little material pertaining to Roper's career prior to his appointment to the cabinet
        post. Also, files for 1931 are almost entirely missing, and cross-reference sheets in the
        collection prepared by Roper's staff appear to refer to a separate set of files missing from
        this collection. There is relatively little in the papers concerning Roper's personal life,
        except for financial papers.</p>
      <p>Roper's tenure as Secretary of Commerce is primarily documented in the Alphabetical Series,
        which not only is the largest series but also forms the heart of the collection. His support
        of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential campaign probably helped him earn this
        cabinet appointment along with Roper's representation of the old Woodrow Wilson element in
        the Democratic Party. Roper set as a major task the development of mutual confidence,
        cooperation, and a closer relationship between business and government in order to bring
        about a recovery from the depression. Since he had been a tax expert and business consultant
        prior to becoming Secretary, this was a natural role for him. In fact in 1933 he had
        organized a Business Advisory and Planning Council for the Department of Commerce to advise
        the administration on the effect of the New Deal's proposals on business. After serving in
        the administration for almost six years, Roper resigned to return to private life.</p>
      <p>The Alphabetical Series includes correspondence from a large number of prominent senators
        and congressmen, men in government service, businessmen, lawyers, judges, and New Deal
        figures. These include Bernard Baruch, James Byrnes, Patrick Callahan, James Cannon, Thomas
        Chadbourne, David Coker, Homer Cummings, Josephus Daniels, William Dodd, Ernest Draper,
        Robert Elbert, James Farley, John Garner, and W. Averell Harriman. Other correspondents are
        William Henry Harrison, Edward House, Louis Howe Cordell Hull, Clarence Hurrey, Jesse Jones,
        Hugh MacRae, William Gibbs McAdoo, George Milton, Robert Owen, Hollins Randolph, Lawrence
        Robert, L.S. Rowe, and John Humphrey Small. The Farley correspondence includes a run of
        first day covers, 1933-1938, while he was Postmaster General. Roper's interest in the stamps
        was piqued in part by the fact that he had been the First Assistant Postmaster General
        appointed by Woodrow Wilson. There are smaller amounts of correspondence with other New Deal
        figures, such as Harry Hopkins, Frances Perkins, and Harold Ickes.</p>
      <p>Information on organizations and topics is scattered throughout the Alphabetical Series.
        They include aeronautics (in Aviation folder); American University; the Board of Education
        of the District of Columbia; commerce (in Foreign Trade folder); communication (radio and
        telegraph); financial federations, specifically The Community Chest of Washington, D.C.; the
        Democratic National Committee; the Democratic Party (in Politics folder); Duke University;
        the Export-Import Bank of Washington; and the Hindenburg accident. Others are the Freemasons
        (in Masons folder); Japanese Economic Mission to the United States; the Methodist Episcopal
        Church, South (also in Methodist Church and Mt. Vernon Place Church folders); the National
        Benefit Life Assurance Company; the National Recovery Administration; the Post Office
        Department; the presidential election of 1932 (in Politics folder); prohibition; religion
        and politics; Franklin D. Roosevelt; and temperance and liquor laws (in Liquor Control
        folder). Roper supported prohibition and in fact had served during the prohibition era as
        Commissioner of Internal Revenue in the Treasury Department, charged with enforcing liquor
        laws. There is information about agencies within or related to the Department of Commerce
        including the Business Advisory Council, the Bureau of the Census (in Census folder), the
        Bureau of Fisheries (in Fisheries folder), and the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce
        (in Foreign and Domestic folder). Other topics represented in the collection include the
        Boxing Bill; the Communications Group; the Inter-departmental Communications Committee (in
        Communications Committee folder), probably a precursor of the Federal Communications
        Commission; and a proposed National Advisory Council.</p>
      <p>Roper's professional views are expressed in the Writings and Speeches Series primarily
        while he served as Commissioner of Internal Revenue and as Secretary of Commerce. The
        speeches address a number of domestic political and economic issues, including the
        relationship of business and government, government regulation, taxation, economic recovery
        from the depression, the U.S. Postal Service, and the role of government in society.</p>
      <p>There is scant evidence in these papers relating to Roper's career other than that as
        Secretary of Commerce and his speeches as Commissioner of Internal Revenue. His
        autobiography, Fifty Years of Public Life in the Writings and Speeches Series, gives an
        overview of his career. There is some information on his career as the First Assistant
        Postmaster General in the Alphabetical Series in the Postmaster General file. In that series
        there is a little information in Internal Revenue Service folders about his resignation as
        Commissioner. In the Clippings Series there is documentation of his brief service as U.S.
        Minister to Canada in the summer of 1939. There is a scrapbook, "My Clippings of Their
        Majesties' Visit to Canada, 1939," and loose clippings pertaining to the visit.</p>
      <p>Roper's personal life is not well documented in the collection except for his financial
        concerns as seen in the Financial Papers Series. The information in that series relates not
        only to the investments and bank accounts of Roper but to his wife Lou McKenzie Roper and
        their children. There is some additional information on the Ropers in the various Roper
        folders and in other scattered folders under various topics in the Alphabetical Series, and
        in the Legal Papers and Pictures in the Miscellaneous Series.</p>
      <p>A photograph album entitled, "Sugar: Story in Pictures," concerning sugar growing in Santo
        Domingo appears in the Miscellaneous Series. In addition this series contains photographs of
        prominent statesmen and others, such as Bernard Baruch, the British Royal family, William
        Jennings Bryan, Grover Cleveland, Josephus Daniels, Averell Harriman, Harold Ickes, Eleanor
        Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. An oil portrait
        of Roper is in the custody of the Special Collections Library. The Clippings Series includes
        scattered information on farming in South Carolina, especially cotton, African Americans,
        racial relations, tariffs, the presidential campaign of 1924 and William Gibbs McAdoo, and
        Roosevelt's cabinet.</p>

          <p>Chiefly typed, professional correspondence to and from Roper, including telegrams,
            memoranda and carbon copies of Roper's outgoing mail. The bulk was generated during
            Roper's tenure as Secretary of Commerce. A variety of other material scattered
            throughout the files includes printed material in the form of pamphlets, booklets, and
            serials; press releases from the Department of Commerce; reports; addresses by Roper and
            others; charts and graphs; organizational records from various groups including minutes,
            budgets, and agendas; clippings; and photographs. A series of folders contains first day
            covers given to Roper by Postmaster James A. Farley. There is a small amount of personal
            correspondence and financial information. Two volumes of correspondence are at the end
            of the series. They are a letterbook of congratulations upon Roper's appointment as
            Secretary of Commerce with copies of Roper's replies, and "Special Letters of
            Congratulation to Daniel C. Roper, March 4, 1933," with Roper's replies. Cross-reference
            sheets prepared by Roper's staff are found frequently throughout the series, many of
            which appear to refer to a separate set of files not in this collection.</p>

          <p>Chiefly typed transcripts, in bound and loose form, of Roper's public addresses and
            statements. The majority, many of which were broadcast over national radio, were
            delivered while Roper was Commissioner of Internal Revenue or Secretary of Commerce.
            Also includes two typed, unbound book manuscripts containing proofreaders' marks;
            correspondence about speaking engagements and book publication; and a small amount of
            press releases, printed speeches, speeches by others, and background material for
            speeches and books. Volumes contain some duplicates of loose material in the series.</p>
