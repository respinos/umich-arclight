        founded in 1960, is an international and inter denominational consortium of scholars that is
        producing a complete critical edition of the works of John Wesley, the 18th century Church
        of England clergyman who was a primary founder of Methodism. The Wesley Works Archive,
        dating from 1676 to 1996, with the bulk ranging from 1724-1791 and 1960-1996, forms part of
        the working papers of the Wesley Works Editorial Project (WWEP). The collection consists of
        that portion of the project's documents gathered by Frank Baker during almost four decades
        of service as the WWEP's editor and main bibliographer, and consists of the correspondence,
        writings, research, printed materials, photocopied manuscripts, proofs, and other materials
        produced by Baker and the many other historians, theologians, and clergy, who have
        participated in the Project. There is much information not only about the founding and early
        history of the Methodist and Wesleyan Methodist Churches, but also about the history of
        religious thought and dissent in 18th century England, the Evangelical Revival, and the
        history of publishing; materials in the collection also throw light on such topics as
        scholarly publishing and textual criticism.</abstract>

      <p>In addition to the four originating universities, the following sponsoring bodies have been
        added since the project's 1960 inception: Boston University School of Theology, the
        Conference of the Methodist Church of Great Britain, The General Commission on Archives and
        History of The United Methodist Church, The United Methodist Board of Higher Education and
        Ministry, and the World Methodist Council.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Wesley Works Archive, 1676-1996 and undated, bulk 1724-1791,
          1960-1996,</emph> forms part of the working papers of the Wesley Works Editorial Project
        (WWEP). Formed in 1960, this international and inter denominational consortium of scholars
        is producing a complete critical edition of the works of John Wesley, the 18th century
        Church of England clergyman who was a primary founder of Methodism. The collection consists
        of that portion of the Project's documents gathered by Frank Baker during almost four
        decades of service as the WWEP's General Editor, Textual Editor, and main bibliographer, and
        consists of the correspondence, writings, research, printed materials, photocopied
        manuscripts, proofs, and other materials produced by Baker and the many other historians,
        theologians, and clergy who have participated in the Project. Because John Wesley preached,
        wrote, and published so widely, the content of the research materials required for a full
        edition of his writings necessarily contains much information not only about the founding
        and early history of the Methodist and Wesleyan Methodist Churches, but also much
        information about the history of religious thought and dissent in 18th century England, the
        Evangelical Revival, and the history of publishing. Beyond the ostensible purpose of the
        WWEP, however, the modern correspondence and scholarly debate contained in these papers also
        throws light on such topics as scholarly publishing and textual criticism.</p>
      <p>The collection also sheds light on the history and mechanics of the transmission of texts.
        That is, while the reproduced printed materials here document the complex publishing and
        textual history of the thousands of editions of Wesley's writings to appear in his lifetime
        alone, at the same time the original writings of modern scholars involved in the WWEP
        document how older texts are researched and recovered from the past, all for the purpose of
        establishing a present authoritative text to be passed on to the future.</p>
      <p>Series in the Wesley Works Archive are arranged to correspond to the unit structure of the
        thirty-five volume <title type="simple" render="italic">Bicentennial Edition</title>.
        Described more fully below, the initial sixteen series of the archive and the sixteen units
        and thirty-five volumes of the <title type="simple" render="italic">Bicentennial
          Edition</title> are as follows: <emph render="bold"><emph render="italic">Sermons</emph>
          (1-4); <emph render="italic">Explanatory Notes upon the New Testament</emph> (5-6); <emph
            render="italic">A Collection of Hymns for the Use of the People called Methodists</emph>
          (7); <emph render="italic">Worship </emph>(8); <emph render="italic">The Methodist
            Societies</emph> (9-10); <emph render="italic">The Appeals to Men of Reason and Religion
            and Certain Related Open Letters</emph> (11); <emph render="italic">Doctrinal and

            ><emph render="italic">Index and Miscellanea</emph> (35).</emph> A concluding
        seventeenth series, <emph render="bold">General Files</emph>, gathers materials about the
        overall history and organization of the WWEP.</p>
      <p>The history of the Wesley Works Editorial Project already extends more than fifty years,
        from its inception in 1960 to the 2011 publication of <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >The Methodist Societies: The Minutes of Conference</title>. This volume, as the
        seventeenth to be published, marks the halfway point of the entire <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Bicentennial Edition,</title> which will comprise thirty-four volumes plus
        a concluding general index volume. Although the <emph render="bold">General Files</emph> are
        placed as the final series in order to avoid interrupting the parallel structure of series
        and volumes, they actually mark the best place to begin an overview of the collection, since
        their various folder groups document much of the administrative history of the Project.
        Overviews and details of the Project's inception, history, institutional support, and
        editorial guidelines are best found in the folder groups for the Board of Directors and the
        Editorial Board. The history of the actual content, intellectual structure, and presentation
        of volumes can be found in such groups as grouped under such categories as Editorial
        Procedures and Bulletins of the WWP. Most of the latter were issued by Frank Baker in the
        1970s and contain much detail about the content and style choices that were being made for
        various volumes. The General Files also contain materials that may relate to more than one
        unit of the <title type="simple" render="italic">Bicentennial Edition,</title> as well as
        some Wesley publications not selected for inclusion, especially his <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Explanatory Notes Upon the Old Testament.</title>

        inter-related Frank Baker collections at Duke may be more clearly demonstrated with a
        specific example. The sermon "Awake, Thou That Sleepest" has been chosen for several
        reasons: its complex publishing history, its ties to several Baker collections, and the
        important fact that it sheds light on researching both John and Charles Wesley. As
        researchers in this field would already know, although the sermon was repeatedly collected
        and published by John, it was originally given by Charles, and that original delivery also
        accounts for the other title by which it is well-known, <title type="simple"

          <p>The first series in the collection, <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph
                render="bold">Sermons</emph>
            </title> is also its largest. It may also provide the fullest and most detailed record
            of the editorial process and scholarly debate behind the production of these volumes. It
            documents almost twenty years of work by two men often regarded as the leading Wesleyan
            scholars of their generation, Albert Outler and Frank Baker, to research, compile, and
            edit the first four volumes of the <title type="simple" render="italic">Bicentennial
              Edition,</title> which contain authoritative critical texts of 151 of John Wesley's
            sermons. Since most of these sermons appeared in several editions during Wesley's
            lifetime, many of these printings included not only Wesley's intended revisions over
            time, but also incorporated a host of printers' errors over the course of several
            decades. Many of individual sermons contain copies of ten or more editions photocopied
            here, and some contain over thirty. Untangling this history to arrive at Wesley's
            intended text was the task of Outler as unit editor for the <emph render="italic"
              >Sermons</emph>, in tandem with Baker as Textual Editor and Editor-in-Chief. Their
            correspondence documents not only their ongoing partnership, but also their sometimes
            heated exchanges over the exact reading and presentation of texts that lie at the
            foundation and perhaps the heart of Methodist history, doctrine, and belief.</p>
          <p>Early dates reflect photocopies, not original materials. The Sermons series begins with
            the <emph render="bold">General Planning Subseries</emph>, highlighted by correspondence
            between Frank Baker, Albert Outler, Richard Heitzenrater, and other editors; and by a
            typescript of an early version of the general introduction. Following this is the <emph
              render="bold">Stemmata Subseries</emph>, composed of hundreds of photocopies of
            editions of Wesley's sermons as they were published by various 18th-century publishers,
            in the <title type="simple" render="italic">Arminian Magazine,</title> and in various
            editions of the <title type="simple" render="italic">Sermons on Several
              Occasions</title>. These photocopies document Frank Baker's work to derive the stemma
            in order to arrive at the most authentic text possible.</p>
          <p>The next step in this process is documented in the <emph render="bold">Texts
              Subseries</emph>, which is roughly divided into two folders groups of "preliminary
            texts" and "styled preliminary texts." These latter represent a later stage in the
            editing process, where decisions are made about spelling, punctuation, style, and other
            concerns to render a text that is both true to the 18th century originals and cognizant
            of modern readers.</p>
          <p>The remaining four subseries, <emph render="bold">Sermons I, II, III, and IV</emph>,
            document the completion of this unit as the four volumes approached publication, one at
            a time, in the 1980s. Each subseries contains many versions of typescripts and proofs,
            many of them heavily edited by Baker and by various editors at Oxford University Press
            and Abingdon Press. All four volumes of the <title type="simple" render="italic"
              >Sermons</title> have been published, one each year from 1984-1987; the unit editor
            was Albert C. Outler.</p>

          <p>The series, <emph render="bold"><title type="simple" render="italic">Explanatory Notes
                upon the New Testament</title></emph>, houses correspondence, research, and
            typescripts for Volumes 5 and 6. Most of the material here documents the efforts of
            Baker and the original unit editor, John Lawson, to arrive at a full working draft of
            John Wesley's commentary on the New Testament. There is also material concerning <title
              type="simple" render="italic">The Remains or Several Select Scriptures Of the New
              Testament opened and explained</title> of Robert Gell, D. D. (1676), an Arminian
            commentary on the New Testament. An extensive, perhaps full, photocopy of this edition
            of "Gell's Remains" is included here, along with notes by Baker in which he traces
            Gell's influence on Wesley.</p>
          <p>Correspondence, research, and typescripts for Volumes 5 and 6. Most of the material
            here documents the editors' efforts to arrive at a preliminary text, thus photocopies
            and typescripts of various editions of Wesley's work comprise the bulk of this series.
            Files are arranged in the categories of correspondence, research, and texts, with the
            last category further arranged in order of composition (stemmata, preliminary texts, and
            styled texts). Baker's main correspondent here is original unit editor John Lawson (d.
            2003); the other unit editor was Scott Jones.</p>

          <p>One of the earlier volumes published, in 1983, is represented in the series <emph
              render="bold"><title type="simple" render="italic">A Collection of Hymns for the Use
                of the People called Methodists.</title>
            </emph> This volume focused on printing a critical text of John Wesley's most famous and
            popular collection of hymns, which first appeared in 1780 and has gone through many
            editions since then. Discussion, planning, and research for Volume 7 began in the
            mid-1960s and is documented by a large volume of correspondence between Baker and the
            two unit editors, Franz Hildebrandt and Oliver Beckerlegge.</p>
          <p>Files for Volume 7 contain correspondence between Frank Baker, Franz Hildebrandt,
            Oliver A. Beckerlegge, and James Dale; typescripts of the introduction by Hildebrandt;
            the project of James Dale in discovering literary allusions in the hymnody corpus; the
            final typescripts, galleys, and page proofs of the volume. Volume 7 was first published
            in 1983, by Oxford University Press, and republished in 1989 under the Abingdon imprint;
            the unit editors were Franz Hildebrandt and Oliver Beckerlegge, assisted by James Dale.
            Arranged in categories as received.</p>

          <p>The <emph render="bold"><title type="simple" render="italic">Worship</title>
              Series</emph> holds materials for Volume 8, a collection of John Wesley's printed
            liturgical works. The materials here reflect early stages in the editorial process,
            consisting mainly of extensive photocopies and typescripts that were compiled in the
            late 1970s and early 1980s in order to derive stemma and establish authoritative texts.
            Despite the early date of these materials in the history of the project, they include a
            full preliminary typescript of Volume 8, edited by Baker. Another highlight here is some
            later, related work Frank Baker did on <title type="simple" render="italic">Hymns on the
              Lord's Supper,</title> resulting in a 1995 address to a meeting of the Charles Wesley
            Society. </p>
          <p>Material is arranged as received, gathered under the title of each individual work to
            be reprinted in the Worship volume. This titles are then arranged in the order reflected
            in early drafts of the planned table of contents. Volume 8 has not been published. The
            unit editor at the time these materials were produced was Raymond George, with whom
            Baker corresponds here; since then, Geoffrey Wainwright and Karen Westerfield Tucker
            were also added as unit editors.</p>

              render="italic">Minutes of the Conference</title> (Vol. 10). Completed in 1989, <emph
              render="italic">History, Nature, and Design</emph> collects a variety of documents,
            published intermittently throughout Wesley's life, in which in which he attempted to
            define what a Methodist and Methodism were, and how its societies were to be organized
            within the Church of England. The materials gathered here contain research, typescripts,
            and proofs that outline the entire history of the volume's inception, development, and
            publication. <emph render="italic">Minutes of the Conference,</emph> on the other hand,
            did not appear until 2011, some twenty to thirty years after these materials were
            researched and written, so this subseries reflects only the early stages of the volume's
            development. The subseries consists mainly of photocopies, although many have been
            densely annotated by Baker, collated, and transcribed into preliminary typescripts. The
            highlight of this subseries may lie in Baker's unpublished index of John Wesley's
            preachers. Deemed too long for the published volume, this work compiles brief but
            detailed chronologies of some 600 18th-century Methodist preachers in England: where
            they served, when they moved, and other highlights of their lives and careers.</p>
          <p>Arranged in two subseries that comprise volumes 9 and 10, respectively: History,
            Nature, and Design; and Minutes of the Conference. See subseries notes for further

              biographical index of some 600 of JW's preachers. Unit editor for Volume 10 is Henry
              Rack, who took over from his predecessor, John Bowmer, in the 1980s.</p>

                and Religion and Certain Related Open Letters</title>
            </emph> (Vol. 11). The <emph render="italic">Appeals</emph> volume gathers printed
            materials and open letters by Wesley in which he attempted to publicly clarify his
            ecclesiastical and theological positions, sometimes out of the need to respond to
            attacks and correct public misconceptions of the Methodist societies. </p>
          <p>Volume 11 was the first volume published by Oxford University Press, in 1975; it was
            also re-published by Abingdon Press in 1987. Materials here relate only to the initial
            edition. The series opens with a short folder group of correspondence, followed by a
            single folder of various photographs used in the volume. The remainder of the series
            consists of successive drafts of typescripts and various stages of proofs. Typescripts
            include both preliminary texts, with notes on stemmata, and styled texts. Most of the
            correspondence and discussion here is between Baker and Gerald R. Cragg, unit editor for
            the <emph render="italic">Appeals</emph>.</p>

          <p>Correspondence, notes, and a typescript for Volumes 12 and 13, in preparation. Although
            not extensive, the correspondence contains discussion between Baker and a succession of
            unit editors over the course of some twenty years, including original unit editors John
            Deschner (Vol. 12) and William R. Cannon (Vol. 13). A long typescript of almost 800
            pages was prepared by Baker in 1981 for a subsequent unit editor, Robert Cushman (Vol.
            12). Although this typescript is a fair copy, most of its sections contain notes on
            stemma and extensive bracketed notes by Baker on all aspects of the text. The series
            concludes with a prospective list of titles, prepared around 1980, for <title
              type="simple" render="italic">The Defence of Christianity</title> (the original title
            for Vol. 13). In addition to the materials included here, shorter typescripts for
            individual works may be found in <title type="simple" render="italic">Arminian
              Magazine.</title> in the <emph render="bold">Catechetical/Educational Works Series
              (Vol. 15).</emph> Unit editors included Paul Chilcote and Randy Maddox (Vol. 12); and
            Ken Collins (Vol. 13).</p>

          <p>Volumes 14 and 15 were originally conceived as a single unit to be entitled "Pastoral
            and Educational Works" and edited by A. Lamar Cooper. This plan lasted until at least
            the mid-1980s, encompassing all the materials gathered here. Since current rather than
            original titles are being used for the series in this inventory, the assignment of these
            typescripts to Volume 15 is somewhat arbitrary--in reality, there is no differentiation
            between the two volumes here. There are preliminary texts for each tract as originally
            planned for the volume; copies of a collated typescript; and correspondence. Unit
            editors were David Hempton (Vol. 14) and Rex Matthews and Rebekah Miles (Vol. 15).</p>

          <p>This volume focuses on JW's extensive work in editing and re-publishing the works of
            other authors. Materials for this series comprise only a few folders, ending a few
            months after the 1983 death of the original unit editor, T. Walter Herbert.
            Correspondence between Baker and Herbert begins in 1970 and continues through the early
            1980s. One correspondence folder contains the main piece of original research and
            writing found here, a 1982 draft of Herbert's introduction for the volume. The remainder
            of the series consists of photocopied articles on the history of printing and principles
            of bibliography; their direct relationship to this volume is unclear, and they are
            similar to other materials to be found in the <emph render="bold">Bibliography

          <p>This volume focuses on Wesley's writings on medicine and other topics in the sciences.
            In addition to a few folders of texts--mainly photocopies--at the end of the series, the
            materials here comprise two small groups of correspondence and research, one from the
            1970s and one from 1990s. The former is concerned with general planning for this unit,
            which early on had the broader title, or rather theme, of "Medicine and Natural
            Philosophy." The later group of correspondence is mainly between Baker and James Donat,
            who first contacted Baker in 1995 about research he was conducting on Wesley's <title
              type="simple" render="italic">Primitive Physick,</title> independently of the Wesley
            Works Editorial Project. Donat served as co-editor of this unit along with Randy
            Maddox.</p>

                <p>An extended note by Baker on these folders explains that this copy of the page
                  proofs contains hundreds of his suggestions, not used by Heitzenrater in the
                  published version, to retain Wesley's original punctuation and spelling. Baker
                  further explains that both he and Heitzenrater as General Editor had good reasons
                  for disagreeing and asks that this alternate copy of the proofs be retained.</p>

          <p>The seven volumes of John Wesley's letters comprised one of the two units of the <title
              type="simple" render="italic">Bicentennial Edition</title> for which Frank Baker was
            originally slated to be unit editor. Although he completed only the first two of those
              volumes--<title type="simple" render="italic">Letters I: 1721-1739</title> and <title
              type="simple" render="italic">Letters II: 1740-1755</title> (Volumes 25 and 26,
            respectively)--the <emph render="bold"><title type="simple" render="italic"
                >Letters</title> Series</emph> contains not only those materials but many more that
            Baker gathered in preparation for the entire series. The series is arranged in two large
            subseries, <emph render="bold">General Files</emph> and <emph render="bold"
              >Volumes.</emph> The latter is composed mainly of materials specific to the two
            volumes published during Baker's lifetime, including correspondence, notes, and many
            versions of typescripts and proofs. The General Files Subseries, however, contains
            materials for Baker's preparation for all seven volumes, some of which extend well past
            the 1755 end-date of Volume 26. Among the highlights here are the hundreds of
            photocopies of manuscript letters, both to and from Wesley, collected from archives
            around the world. Although these are in theory available from the original holding
            archive, where known, the fact of their being collected in single place makes this a
            valuable resource for studying Wesley's correspondence and correspondents. Another item
            of interest, entirely unique to this collection, is the notebook labeled "Early log of
            Wesley letters." Undated but probably from the mid-1970s to early 1980s, this notebook
            sheds light on Baker's research methods as well as providing a resource for studying
            Wesley's correspondence. It lists in chronological order, from 1725 to 1791, the date,
            place written, recipient, place received, prior publication if any, and present archival
            location of some 4000 John Wesley manuscript letters around the world. Its content
            extends well beyond the content presently available in either the published volumes of
            the <title type="simple" render="italic">Bicentennial Edition</title> or in the previous
            standard for Wesley's letters, the Telford edition.</p>
          <p>The Letters series (Vol. 25-31) showcases the meticulous work of Frank Baker, editor of
            the series: here is his correspondence with international libraries to obtain extant
            Wesley letters; research concerning Wesley's correspondents; and many layers of editing
            the letters. The Wesley Works Archive contains relevant photocopies, not original
            manuscripts, of JW's letters. The bulk of the materials relate to the two volumes of
            letters published during Baker's lifetime--volumes 25 and 26 of the <title type="simple"
              render="italic">Bicentennial Edition</title>--which cover Wesley's letters through
            1755. However, there are also some materials for volume 27 and many materials that
            document Baker's extensive preparation for the entire 7 volume letters unit. These
            last-named materials, however, actually appear first in the following arrangement, under
            the heading of General Planning. Following that are the materials for individual volumes
            of the Letters. Frank Baker was the original unit editor and saw the first two of seven
            volumes into publication. The unit editors for the remaining volumes were Ted Campbell
            and Philip Meadows.</p>

            <p>The General Planning Subseries is arranged in several folder groups that outline
              Baker's extensive preparations for the entire Letters unit. The first group,
              Acquisition of Letters, contains his notes on antiquarian catalogs, indexes he
              compiled of 19th century Methodist periodicals, and back issues of Sotheby catalogs,
              dating to the early 20th century, in which Wesley letters were offered for sale.
              Correspondence is composed of two types of materials: his contact with other Wesleyan
              scholars; and the hundreds of inquiries he made to international archives in the
              mid-1970s about their holding of Wesley manuscripts (the letters shown here are mainly
              replies in the negative).</p>
            <p>Folders grouped under Identification comprise files about letters with either
              questionable dating or attribution, but also many details about the physical
              characteristics of letters that help in their proper identification, such as franks,
              seals, watermarks, and how to identify not only Wesley's handwriting but that of his
              various scribes and amanuenses.</p>
            <p>Indexes and Logs houses Baker's and other scholars' work on listing and categorizing
              Wesley's voluminous letters. In addition to the folders in this group, several other
              card files and indexes can be found in the Frank Baker Papers, Subject Files Series,
              Card Files Subseries, which houses over 30 indexes and 40,000 cards that Baker
              compiled for his own use as well as that of the Project.</p>
            <p>Following Indexes and Logs are several folder groups of reproductions of thousands of
              Wesley letters, both outgoing and incoming, compiled from various sources and
              organized in various ways: Letters from Printed Sources, Letters by Archive, Letters
              by Correspondent, and Letters by Chronology.</p>
            <p>The last three groups contain photocopies and microfilm printouts of hundreds of
              manuscript letters from and to JW, many of which have not yet appeared in printed
              form. There are far too many to cite here individually, but some of these are noted in
              the finding aid, with preference being given to those more difficult to access, such
              as those from smaller archives and those that have never been published in either the
              Telford or Abingdon editions of the Wesley's letters.</p>

          <p>The penultimate unit of the <title type="simple" render="italic">Bicentennial
              Edition</title> is represented in the <emph render="italic">Bibliography </emph>
            Series. Aside from the Letters, this was the only other portion for which Frank Baker
            served as the original unit editor. Planned as Volumes 33-34 but left incomplete at his
            death, the <emph render="italic">Bibliography</emph> was only one instantiation of a
            topic on which he labored for several decades: documenting the publishing history of the
            editions of their writings that appeared in print during the lifetimes of John and
            Charles Wesley. Independently of his work on the WWEP, and yet also in preparation for
            it, Baker had already published <title type="simple" render="italic">A Union Catalogue
              of the Publications of John and Charles Wesley</title> in 1966. Although this title
            and the work-in-progress he called "A Descriptive and Analytical Bibliography" may at
            first sound like two names for more or less the same thing, the latter is in fact a
            radically different work. The words "descriptive" and "analytical" in the title were not
            added lightly: each publication with a completed entry in the bibliography is taken up
            and considered in a full-length essay. Baker of course provides the expected
            bibliographic details for all editions to appear in Wesley's lifetime, derives the
            stemma or publishing genealogy of each work, and lists holdings around the world, just
            as in the Union Catalogue. But here he does far more. He also discusses each work's
            place in the Wesley canon, considers everything from how and why it came to be written
            and published, to its reception history, to the ways Wesley used and adapted it in
            successive printings over the years. In short, the drafts and typescripts collected
            here, though uncompleted, go well beyond "bibliography" or even "annotated bibliography"
            as those terms are generally conceived. They set out to describe in full a publishing
            phenomenon that spanned two-thirds of the 18th century: the life in print of a speaker,
            writer, editor, and abridger whose works appeared in more than four thousand editions in
            his own lifetime alone.</p>
          <p>Arranged in four subseries: <emph render="bold">General Planning; Printers and
              Printing; Stemmata and Texts;</emph> and <emph render="bold">Typescripts</emph>.
            Because his work on the "Descriptive and Analytical Bibliography" required Baker to
            consult so many thousands of editions of works by John and Charles Wesley, this series
            has an extremely complex relationship not only with other series in the current
            collection but also with other collections at Duke. The outline provided below is not
            exhaustive in explicating these relationships, but does provide guidance about when to
            expect to find related materials at Duke, and where to search. Frank Baker was the
            original unit editor for Volumes 33 and 34, and authored almost all the original
            material in this series, the bulk of which dates to the 1970s and 1980s. Unit editors
            were Page Thomas and Richard P. Heitzenrater.</p>

            information at Duke on particular publications by JW, see also the following

            <p>Contains Baker's research on individual publication histories of the first 94 works
              to be listed in the <emph render="italic">Bibliography</emph>, plus various work on
              scattered higher-numbered entries. Most folders contain photocopies of multiple
              editions of these works, Baker's drafts and notes for the individual publication
              history of the work, and an outline of the stemma. In theory, Baker's writing and
              notes here should match the more polished versions to be found in the full 1981
              typescript to be found in the next subseries; in practice, though, no comparison has
              been made, so there are likely to be handwritten notes here that are not included in
              the fair copy typescript. For this subseries, due to the high proportion of partial
              and full photocopies and transcribed materials, the dates in the box list reflect only
              the initial publication dates that Baker cited for each work. Although no attempt has
              been made to include dates of all items in each folder, in most cases it can be
              assumed that materials photocopied from later 18th century editions are
              included--gathering such editions for evaluation was the point of the research.
              Baker's own writing and notes are almost all undated, but it the bulk of this work was
              done by the early 1980s. Arranged in order of the new numbering scheme assigned by
              Baker for the <emph render="italic">Bibliography</emph>; the equivalent older number,
              based on the earlier bibliographies of Baker and Richard Green, is indicated in
              parentheses. Researchers should note that while this list stops at item 94, short of
              the 106 in the full typescript in the next folder group, it also picks up again with
              miscellaneous manuscripts for handful of citations above 106.</p>

            <p>This subseries contains the most complete version Baker left of the two-volume
              bibliography for the <title type="simple" render="italic">Bicentennial
              Edition</title>. The core of this version is a draft he completed in 1981 and
              distributed to other project editors and scholars. More than 700 pages long, this
              manuscript contained Baker's essays and stemma for the first 106 titles in the Wesley
              bibliography (out of approximately 800 intended entries). To this version he added
              corrections and updated pages at various points in the 1980s and early 1990s. He then
              sent the 1991 version to the libraries of several universities participating in the
              WWEP (Drew, Emory, SMU, and Duke). This draft does not exactly match the list of
              individually foldered texts and stemma in the previous subseries. That list stops
              earlier, at item 94, but also picks up again with scattered higher-numbered entries in
              the bibliography.</p>
